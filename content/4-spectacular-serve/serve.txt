    Bring the glass and the bottle of Q to
    your guest. A tray is nice, but not
    necessary. Either way, present the drink
    like you’re presenting something
    special. You are.

    Open the bottle in front of your guest
    and pause while it “pops.” Slowly
    pour into the glass until ¾ full. To
    maintain carbonation, tilt the glass
    20° as you pour the liquid down the
    side.

    Place the glass and the bottle down in
    front of your guest and encourage them
    to top off the drink as desired. Leave
    the bottle cap alongside the glass.
