She then moved to the US and joined the small team that built and launched Belvedere and Chopin Vodka.

Stoli Vodka approached her to build their new sales force for the US and reestablish its brand health.  Once growth was established the greatest challenge of her career unfolded  – building a distributor network in the US and firmly planting Q in the best bars, hotels, restaurants and retail establishments in the US.'
