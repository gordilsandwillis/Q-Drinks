    Q Light Ginger Beer has a strong ginger
    punch and is very spicy. That’s
    because we use real ginger, and lots of
    it. Watch out.

    Chili peppers add an extra kick to Q
    Light Ginger Beer, particularly at the
    front of the palate.

  title: CORIANDER AND CARDAMOM

    For depth and complexity – the
    coriander adds warm, nutty, and spicy
    notes while the cardamom delivers an
    aromatic, resinous fragrance.

  title: Lime
  description: >
    To prevent scurvy British sailors were
    given a daily ration of limes, earning
    them the nickname “Limeys.” Such
    drastic measures aren’t needed these
    days. But limes do give Q Light Ginger
    Beer a nice subtle top note.

  title: Extra Carbonation
  description: >
    A drink stays fizzier longer when it
    starts with more carbonation. So we use
    a custom, thicker glass bottle that
    enables us to craft Q Light Ginger Beer
    with more carbonation – 4.0 gas
    volumes to be precise.
