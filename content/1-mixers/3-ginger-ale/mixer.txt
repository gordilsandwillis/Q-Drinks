Description: One hundred years ago, bottlers measured their worth by their ginger ale. Q Ginger Ale is our manifesto. Not too sweet. Clean and crisp with a gingery bite. And real depth from a subtle mix of rose oil and spices. Truly spectacular.

    The agave cactus produces a nectar
    prized by chefs worldwide for its gently
    rounded sweetness. We make Q Ginger Ale
    with a dash of organic agave, not high
    fructose corn syrup or sugar. This gives
    it more depth and a cleaner, crisper
    taste.

  description: >
    Rose oil costs more than $1000 an ounce.
    We select ingredients on taste alone, so
    to make the very best ginger ale, we add
    a touch of rose oil. This costs more.
    But it adds depth and complexity, making
    Q Ginger Ale truly spectacular.

    Two seeds make Q Ginger Ale even more
    special – the coriander adds warm,
    nutty, and spicy notes while the
    cardamom delivers an aromatic, resinous
    fragrance.
