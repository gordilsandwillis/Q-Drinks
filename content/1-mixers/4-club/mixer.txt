Description: Spectacular club soda? Yes. As much carbonation as the bottle will physically hold. And a dash of Himalayan salt to make anything you mix with it even tastier.

  description: >
    Salt pulls out flavor. That’s why you
    put in on steak. Himalayan salt is known
    for its high mineral content. It pulls
    more subtleties from the great spirits
    it is mixed with. And it’s why whiskey
    distillers rave about Q Club Soda.

  title: Extra carbonation
  description: >
    A drink stays fizzier longer when it
    starts with more carbonation. So we use
    a custom, thicker glass bottle that
    enables us to craft Q Club Soda with
    more carbonation – 4.5 gas volumes to
    be precise.
