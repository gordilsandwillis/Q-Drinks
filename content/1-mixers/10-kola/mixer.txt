Description: 

Cola should be a combination of tang, spice, sweet, and savory. But the balance in today's colas is all syrupy sweet with hardly any spice. Which is to say, there really is no balance at all.

So we started over. With a mix of carefully selected spices from real trees and plants. Think you know how a cola should taste, especially when mixed with rum or whiskey? If you haven’t tried Q Kola, you don’t.

  title: Kola Nut
  description: 'A sweet-smelling but bitter-tasting nut whose legend has been passed down from generation to generation among West African tribes. As they hunt, they slowly chew it to stay ready for the kill. That’s because each kola nut contains natural caffeine - more than a strong cup of coffee.'

  description: >
    In the Bible, Moses is commanded to use
    cinnamon in the holy anointing oil.
    We’re trying to stay a bit humble with
    Q Kola. But we know the sweet, spiciness
    of the cinnamon sure makes it taste
    great.

  description: >
    The woody, sweet nut of an evergreen
    native to the Banda Islands, near
    Indonesia. These islands were fought
    over until 1667, when the British ceded
    them to the Dutch in exchange for a city
    called New Amsterdam, which they quickly
    renamed New York.

    The aromatic flower buds of an evergreen
    also native to the Banda Islands, which
    are known as the “Spice Islands.”
    They add a warm and pleasant note to Q
    Kola.

  title: Vanilla
  description: >
    A vanilla orchid can be naturally
    pollinated only by a species of bees
    that survives only in parts of Mexico.
    So today the pods of these beautifully
    fragranced flowers are usually created
    by hand-insemination. Even more
    challenging – each flower lasts just a
    day...

  title: 'Lemon & Lime'
  description: >
    John Pemberton’s original recipe for
    Coca Cola contained fruits and spices
    designed to mask the flavor of its wine
    and cocaine. The laws have changed, but
    the fact remains. Lemons and limes still
    add a tangy deliciousness.

  title: Organic Agave
  description: >
    Unlike other colas that use tons of high
    fructose corn syrup or sugar, we craft Q
    Kola with a dash of organic agave
    nectar. This gives it more depth and a
    much cleaner, crisper taste.
