    What to do? Sure it prevented malaria.
    But their bitter quinine medicine was
    tough to get down. Luckily for us, a few
    ingenious British officers resolved this
    quandary by mixing their meds with gin,
    sugar, and carbonated water. The gin and
    tonic was born. We’ve returned to the
    original essence of tonic water with
    quinine from Cinchona bark grown in its
    native habitat, the slopes of the
    Peruvian Andes.

  title: extra carbonation
  description: >
    A drink stays fizzier longer when it
    starts with more carbonation. So we use
    a custom, thicker glass bottle that
    enables us to use more carbonation –
    4.5 gas volumes to be precise.
