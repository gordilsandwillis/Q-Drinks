Description: We love Palomas. Q Grapefruit exists for one reason: to make your Paloma spectacular. A mixer, not a soda, Q Grapefruit is fresh, bitter, and very tart. Our secret? Grapefruits. There is nothing else like it. Mix it with tequila, or vodka if you prefer. Add a squeeze of lime. Spectacular.

  description: 'Most grapefruit sodas are loaded with sugar. Like they’re trying to hide the grapefruit from us. Q Grapefruit actually tastes like grapefruits – fresh, bitter and tart with just a hint of sweetness.  Why? Because we use lots of real grapefruits from sunny Florida.'
