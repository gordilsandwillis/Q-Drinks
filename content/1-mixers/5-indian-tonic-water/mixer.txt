Description: Purpose-built to mix with London Dry gins. More bitter and a little sweeter than our original Q Tonic Water but with all the extra carbonation, Q Indian Tonic is crafted to complement the strongest, most juniper-forward gins.

  title: Quinine
  description: 'Quinine comes from the bark of the Cinchona tree. Or at least it used to, back when the gin & tonic was invented. Weâ€™ve returned to the original essence of tonic water with quinine from Cinchona bark grown in its native habitat, the slopes of the Peruvian Andes.'

  title: Extra carbonation
  description: >
    A drink stays fizzier longer when it
    starts with more carbonation. So we use
    a custom, thicker glass bottle that
    enables us to use 4.5 gas volumes of
    carbonation.
