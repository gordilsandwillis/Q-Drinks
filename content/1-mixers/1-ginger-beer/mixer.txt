Description: Other ginger beers try to be both a spicy soda and a mixer. So they end up doing neither well. Q Ginger Beer is a mixer and a mixer only – it  is spicier, more carbonated and less sweet. It is exactly what your vodka, rum, or whiskey is looking for.

    Q Ginger Beer has a strong ginger punch
    and is very spicy. That’s because we
    use real ginger, and lots of it. Watch
    out.

  description: >
    Unlike other ginger beers that use tons
    of high fructose corn syrup or sugar, we
    craft Q Ginger Beer with a dash of
    organic agave. This gives it a cleaner,
    crisper taste and more depth.

    Chili peppers add an extra kick to Q
    Ginger Beer, particularly at the front
    of the palate.

    For depth and complexity – the
    coriander adds warm, nutty, and spicy
    notes while the cardamom delivers an
    aromatic, resinous fragrance.

  description: >
    To prevent scurvy British sailors were
    given a daily ration of limes, earning
    them the nickname “Limeys.” Such
    drastic measures aren’t needed these
    days. But limes do give Q Ginger Beer a
    nice subtle top note.

  title: Extra Carbonation
  description: >
    A drink stays fizzier longer when it
    starts with more carbonation. So we use
    a custom, thicker glass bottle that
    enables us to craft Ginger Beer with
    more carbonation – 4.0 gas volumes to
    be precise.
