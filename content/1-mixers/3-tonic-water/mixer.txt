Description: 

After a night drinking good gin with great friends and lousy tonic water, Jordan was inspired to create a better tonic water. Q Tonic Water has sharp flavor and high carbonation, so it doesn’t get lost in your drink. And it’s much less sweet so the subtleties of a great gin shine through.

Q Tonic Water complements great spirits rather than overpowering them. Proudly served at America’s most discerning restaurants, Q Tonic Water makes your drink spectacular.

  description: >
    What to do? Sure it prevented malaria.
    But their bitter quinine medicine was
    tough to get down. Luckily for us, a few
    ingenious British officers resolved this
    quandary by mixing their meds with gin,
    sugar, and carbonated water. The gin and
    tonic was born. We’ve returned to the
    original essence of tonic water with
    quinine from Cinchona bark grown in its
    native habitat, the slopes of the
    Peruvian Andes.

  title: Organic Agave
  description: >
    Agave nectar is prized by chefs
    worldwide for its gently rounded
    sweetness. We use just dash of organic
    agave, not tons of high fructose corn
    syrup or sugar. This allows the
    subtleties in your gin to shine through.
    It also means Q Tonic has about half the
    calories of other tonic waters.

  title: Extra Carbonation
  description: 'A drink stays fizzier longer when it starts with more carbonation. So we use a custom, thicker glass bottle that enables us to use more  carbonation – 4.5 gas volumes to be precise.'
