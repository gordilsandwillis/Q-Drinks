Method: Fill a highball glass with ice and add your choice of gin. Then pour in the Q Light Tonic Water. Gently stir and garnish with a lime wedge.

Variations: Have some fun. Add a full lime wedge for a citrus boost, Swap in a different garnish, maybe a grapefruit, cucumber, or lime twist. Or muddle in a fresh herb â€“ thyme can be great. Or even add a few dashes of bitters, Angostura or orange bitters work well.
