Method: Fill a highball glass with ice. Pour in the tequila and squeeze in a lime. Then pour in the Q Grapefruit. Gently stir and garnish with a lime.

----

Variations: To create a spicy salt rim, mix salt and jalapeno and spread out on a plate. Run a lime along the rim of a highball, then dip the rim into the salt mixture .  Try mezcal rather than tequila for a smokier drink.  A tiny splash of agave is a fun way to add some sweetness if preferred.
