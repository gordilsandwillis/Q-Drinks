Method: Fill a highball glass or copper mug with ice. Pour in the vodka and squeeze in the lime, leaving the lime shell in the glass. Then pour in the Q Light Ginger Beer, and gently stir. Wow – spicy, bubbly, and clean – and with fewer calories.

Variations: Because Q Light Ginger Beer is less sweet than other ginger beers, it leaves more room to add a special flair. Try adding fresh juice (watermelon is great!) or a dash of bitters for some more complexity.
