Method: 

Fill a highball glass with ice. 
Pour in the Q Ginger Beer and squeeze in the lime. Top with the rum so it floats on the top, looking like a dark storm cloud that will force you to stay at the bar all afternoon. Stay at the bar all afternoon.

Variations: Because Q Ginger Beer is less sweet than other ginger beers, it leaves more room to add a modifier. Try adding 2 oz fresh juice â€“ pineapple for a Summer Storm or apple cider for a Dark, Stormy, and Cidery.
