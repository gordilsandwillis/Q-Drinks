Method: Fill a highball glass with ice and add your choice of gin. Then pour in the Q Tonic Water or Q Indian Tonic Water, depending on the gin. London Dry gins should get the Q Indian Tonic Water and more subtle gins should get Q Tonic Water. Gently stir and garnish with a lime wedge.

Variations: Have some fun. Add a full lime wedge for a citrus boost. Swap in a different garnish, maybe a grapefruit, cucumber, or lime twist. Or muddle in a fresh herb – thyme can be great. Or even add ½ oz of your favorite liqueur; pamplemousse or  elderflower both work well.
