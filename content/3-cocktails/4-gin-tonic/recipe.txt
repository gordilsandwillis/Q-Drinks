Method: Place ice in a highball glass and add your favorite gin. Squeeze in a lime wedge. Then pour in the Q Tonic Water or Q Indian Tonic Water, depending on the gin. London Dry gins should get the Q Indian Tonic Water and more subtle gins should get Q Tonic Water. Gently stir and garnish with a lime wedge.

Variations: Have some fun. Swap in a different garnish, maybe a grapefruit, cucumber, or lime twist. Or muddle in a fresh herb â€“ thyme can be great. Or even add an ounce of liqueur, something like pamplemousse or an elderflower.
